# V-Stock – Demo Crypto Trading Platform

## Project Overview
V-Stock is a **demo cryptocurrency trading platform** developed during my internship at **VakıfBank – Application Development and Infrastructure Department**.

The application allows users to:
- Track real-time cryptocurrency prices
- Perform demo buy/sell transactions
- View and manage their transaction history

The project was designed with a strong focus on **secure, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture**, reflecting real-world financial application requirements.

## Key Features
- Real-time cryptocurrency price streaming (Binance WebSocket)
- Demo trading (buy/sell simulation)
- Transaction history tracking
- Secure authentication & authorization (JWT)
- Layered and clean backend architecture
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

---

## Backend Architecture
The backend was developed using **modern enterprise-level design patterns** to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Technologies
- **.NET 8**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **RESTful API**
- **JWT-based Authentication & Authorization**
- **Onion Architecture**
- **Repository Pattern**
- **CQRS**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **SignalR**
- **WebSocket (Binance real-time data)**
- **Dockerized infrastructure**
  - Redis
  - Prometheus
  - Grafana
  - Seq (centralized logging)

---

## Frontend
- **Angular 18**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- Real-time UI updates via SignalR

> *Frontend is implemented to support and visualize backend capabilities; the primary focus of this project is backend system design.*

---

## What I Worked On
- Designed and implemented RESTful backend services
- Modeled database entities and relationships
- Implemented authentication & authorization with JWT
- Integrated real-time market data using WebSocket
- Built demo trading logic and transaction tracking
- Applied clean architecture principles (Onion Architecture, CQRS)
- Containerized services and monitoring tools with Docker

---

## What I Learned
- How enterprise-level backend systems are structured
- Designing secure and scalable financial applications
- Managing real-time data streams in backend services
- Importance of logging, monitoring, and observability
- Working within a corporate development workflow
- Collaboration, code review culture, and professional discipline
